update log:
1 october 2021
-fixed some bugs
-importing maps


 For movement you need to type "w","a","s","d" and press "click me"

 For upgrading the player's skills you need to type "skills" and there are 2 types of skills:
	-strenght which can be upgraded by typing "strenght"
	-accuracy which can be upgraded by typing "accuracy"

 Also for destroying walls you need to type "destroy" and press "click me"


Map importing instructions:
1. Type in the input entry "import map" and press "click me"
2. Search for the map file (*.maps)

Map designing instructions:
- "0" -> permanent wall

- "#" -> destoryable wall

- at the end of each line there must be a "; "(otherwise the map wouldn't work correctly)

- you can also use other characters but it doesn't mean that will be converted

- between each map character there has to be a "*" to link everything together

- in order to make the map work proprly you will need to add some borders

- the map can be any size

- the map should be wrote firstly in .txt format and after that to change the extension of the file into .maps (that's the only format that this game can handle for now)

Map example:

0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0; 
0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0; 
0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0; 
0*0*0*0* * * * * * * * * * * *0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0* *0*0*0*0*0*0* * * *0*0*0*0;

0*0*0*0* * * * * * * * * * * *#* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *0*+* * *0*0*0*0; 
0*0*0*0* * * * * * * * * * * *0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0* * * * * *0*0*0*0; 
0*0*0*0* * * * * * * * * * * *0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0* *X* *0*0*0*0; 
0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0; 
0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0; 
0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0*0
(by the way, you will need this type of huge walls too)
